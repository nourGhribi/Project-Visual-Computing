CS-211-Project-Visual Computing
===================
	
Tangible game using webcam, written with Processing in Java.

The aim of this project is to control the board of the game with a tangible one.
To do this we detect a physical object (A Lego green board) from a webcam image stream, localize the four corners, use them to compute the 3D orientation of the physical board and finally, apply this orientation to the virtual board of your game.
